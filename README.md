# tv-guide-landing-page
Code Challenge

Landing page for a TV Guide. Used HTML, CSS, and jQuery to create this page. Used flex box for layout of section underneath header with logo. Catagories are links that don't go anywhere at this point. Tomorrow's Schedule section used flexbox as well and was created with jQuery and Slick Slider. Made an ajax call to [http://www.tvmaze.com/api](http://www.tvmaze.com/api) to get schedule for tomorrow. Used moment js to get date for tomorrow dynamically. Dynamically added the html for each show with jQuery.
